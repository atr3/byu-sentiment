Very important... to get this project to work you need to download the Stanford CoreNLP software
- http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/corenlp.shtml

And then unzip the file stanford-corenlp-3.3.1-models.jar using 7zip or similar. You should place the /edu directory in the root of this project. This includes the training data needed to run this java project.
